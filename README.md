# 🌻 Chingu Trivia 
Welcome to the Chingu Trivia 🚀, a web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack! This app allows users to engage in trivia quizzes across three categories: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app includes user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure login and score-saving and fetching capabilities.

🎯 **Note:** You don't need to signup/login to take the quiz. However to fetch and save scores, signing up is necessary.

## ✨ Getting Started:
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sushmita-Ghosh/chingu-trivia.git
   ```
2. Install Dependencies for both frontend & backend:
  ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Set Variables in the config.js in backend folder:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI = Create a cluster in mongodb and we need to provide the url here
   SECRET_KEY= Put any string here

   After updation it should look something like this:
   MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.cnjhdht.mongodb.net/chinguusers";
    SECRET_KEY = "mySecret";
   ```
4. Launch frontend & backend in two different terminal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend --> do this in terminal 1
   npm run dev

   cd backend   --> do this in terminal 2
   npm run start
   ```
## 💡 Future Enhancements:
* Need to add the logout functionality. (Currently the token expires in 24hrs but we have removed it from localhost manually).
* Currently the flow is dependent on signup for the username field, so the user would have to sign up for the username to be accessed. Need to add logic for fetching usernames for all signed-up users who are directly logging in. 
* Want to include tests with React Testing Library and Jest.
* Further refactoring of code.

## 🌻 Deployment:
* Used [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/) for web service/api deployment.
* Used [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) for the frontend development
* The project is available [here✨](https://chingu-tect-trivia.netlify.app/).
